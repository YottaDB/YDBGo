// This package is a Go wrapper for a YottaDB database using the SimplaAPI interface. While the functional part
// of this package runs OK with Go 1.10, certain external packages are used by the internal unit tests invoked
// by 'go test' that have been updated to use facilities only present in Go 1.13.0 and later.
//
// This wrapper makes significant use of the 'cgo' facility to interface between this Go wrapper and the YottaDB
// engine written in C. The cgo facility is described here: https://golang.org/cmd/cgo - Note that cgo imposes
// a number of restrictions that the wrapper works very hard to work around - no array subscript references to C
// values, no passing of Go routine pointers to C code, no variadic calls, plus restrictions on parameters. But
// cgo allows us full access to C structures, enums, routines declarations, and simple #define values just by
// including the appropriate C header file and invoking cgo in the prescribed manner as shown below.

// Maximum panic exit wait specifies the wait in seconds that yottadb.Exit() will wait for ydb_exit() to run before
// giving up and forcing the process to exit. Note the normal exit wait is longer as we expect ydb_exit() to be
// successful so can afford to wait as long as needed to do the sync but for a signal exit, the rundown is likely
// already done (exit handler called by the signal processing itself) but if ydb_exit() is not able to get
// the system lock and is likely to hang, 3 seconds is about as much as we can afford to wait.

// on new content, either the third piece of the version will be bumped to an even value or the second piece of the

// piece of the version and zero the others when the changes are significant.
