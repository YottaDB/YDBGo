# YottaDB Go Wrapper v2

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2?style=flat-square)](https://goreportcard.com/report/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2) | [![Go Doc](https://img.shields.io/badge/godoc-reference-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://godoc.org/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2) | [![Coverage report](https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/Lang/YDBGo/badges/master/coverage.svg?job=v2_coverage)](https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/Lang/YDBGo/-/jobs?name=v2_coverage)

Warning: YDBGo v2 is in alpha testing. Reference documentation is on the [Go packages website](https://pkg.go.dev/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2).

## Quick Start

Install YottaDB, a C compiler, and Go, before building YDBGo projects. See [Get Started](https://yottadb.com/product/get-started/) for instructions for installing YottaDB. YDBGo supports versions YottaDB r1.34 or later.

A YottaDB database must be set up and the environment variables configured. This can be done by sourcing `/path/to/yottadb/ydb_env_set`. For example:

```sh
source $(pkg-config --variable=prefix yottadb)/ydb_env_set
```

Once this is done, existing Go programs written for YDBGo should build without further setup.

**Creating your own Go program**

1. Create an empty directory anywhere on your file system and go there.

```
mkdir ydb-example
cd ydb-example
```

2. Use `go mod init` to create a package for your code in a unique namespace:

```
go mod init example.com/yottadb-example
```

3. Create a Go program (e.g. `helloworld.go`) containing your main program with an import of `lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2`, e.g. the [example script in the YDBGo documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2/#pkg-overview), which is:

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2"

func main() {
	defer yottadb.Shutdown(yottadb.MustInit())
	conn := yottadb.NewConn()

	// Store unicode greeting into node ^hello("world")
	greeting := conn.Node("^hello", "world")
	greeting.Set("สวัสดี") // Sawadee (hello in Thai)
	fmt.Println(greeting.Get())

	// Output:
	// สวัสดี
}
```

4. Download the YottaDB module by using `go get .`
5. Run the code using `go run .`
6. You can verify that the data got saved by running `mupip extract -sel=^hello -stdout`

7. `go build` will create an executable for you (`yottadb-example` in this case). You
   can run that directly (e.g. `./yottadb-example`).

8. `go install` will install the executable for you in your Go path ($GOPATH/bin or `~/go` by default).

## Intro by example

To see how to increment or clear database node values, or kill entire node trees, replace `main()` above with:

```go
defer yottadb.Shutdown(yottadb.MustInit())
conn := yottadb.NewConn()

hi := conn.Node("^howdy")            // create Node instance pointing to YottaDB global ^hello
hi.Set("western")
cowboy := hi.Child("cowboy")         // new variable pointing to subnode "cowboy" subscript
cowboy.Set("Howdy partner!")         // set ^hello("cowboy") to "Howdy partner!"
ranches := cowboy.Child("ranches")
ranches.Incr(2)                      // Increment empty node by 2 to get 2

fmt.Printf("First dump:\n%#v\n", hi) // %#v produces the same string as hi.Dump()
cowboy.Kill()                        // delete node, its children, and all values
fmt.Printf("Second dump:\n%#v\n", hi)
hi.Clear()                           // clear this node's value, too

// Output:
// First dump:
// ^howdy="western"
// ^howdy("cowboy")="Howdy partner!"
// ^howdy("cowboy","ranches")=2
//
// Second dump:
// ^howdy="western"
```

**Doing something useful**

Let's use Go to calculate the height of 3 oak trees, based on their shadow length and the angle of the sun. Replace main() with the following code. You will also need to `import "math"`:

```go
defer yottadb.Shutdown(yottadb.MustInit())
conn := yottadb.NewConn()

// capture initial data values into a Go map
data := []map[string]int{
    {"shadow": 10, "angle": 30},
    {"shadow": 13, "angle": 30},
    {"shadow": 15, "angle": 45},
}

// Enter data into the database
trees := conn.Node("^oaks") // node object pointing to YottaDB global ^oaks
for i, items := range data {
    for key, value := range items {
        trees.Child(i+1, key).Set(value)
    }
}

// Iterate data in the database and calculate results
for tree, i := range trees.Children() {
    tree.Child("height").Set(tree.Child("shadow").GetFloat() *
        math.Tan(tree.Child("angle").GetFloat()*math.Pi/180))
    fmt.Printf("Oak %s is %.1fm high\n", i, tree.Child("height").GetFloat())
}

// Output:
// Oak 1 is 5.8m high
// Oak 2 is 7.5m high
// Oak 3 is 15.0m high
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Installing pkg-config

Go's installation of this package uses pkg-config to find `libyottadb.h`. This requires installation of the `yottadb.pc` file, which is generated by default when YottaDB is installed with the recommended `ydbinstall` / `ydbinstall.sh` script.

If you installed YottaDB in some other way that did not create a `yottadb.pc` file, the contents should look something like this:

```sh
prefix=/usr/local/lib/yottadb/r202

exec_prefix=${prefix}
includedir=${prefix}
libdir=${exec_prefix}

Name: YottaDB
Description: YottaDB database library
Version: r2.02
Cflags: -I${includedir}
Libs: -L${libdir} -lyottadb -Wl,-rpath,${libdir}
```

Change the prefix to the correct path for your environment.

NOTE: you cannot use environment variables for the prefix path (e.g. `$ydb_dist`); it must be a fully qualified path.

You can also override the path used by pkg-config to find `yottadb.pc` with the environment variable `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` and a path to where the `yottadb.pc` file resides. You will need to use this method if you have more than one YottaDB release installed on your system.

### Migrating v1 to v2

Applications that use YDBGo v1 will continue to operate without change. To aid migration of large applications from YDBGo v1 to v2, it is possible to use v1 and v2 APIs in the same application code. However, the the two versions cannot use each other's data types so this will only make sense where the old and new functionality is fairly modular. All signal handling will need to be migrated to v2 since v1 signal handlers will no longer be called.

To use both v1 and v2 APIs in one application you will need to add a named import like this:

```go
import v1 "lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb"
```

You must remove any calls to v1 `Init()` and `Exit()` and instead add the following line immediately after calling v2 `Init()`:

```go
v1.ForceInit()  // only available from v1.2.8
```

This will let v1 know that v2 has already done the initialization. You will need to upgrade your `go.mod` to specify at least v1.2.8 for yottadb v1:

```
require lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb v1.2.8
```

## Programming Notes

These notes supplement rather than replace the more general [Programming Notes (Avoiding Common Pitfalls)](https://docs.yottadb.com/MultiLangProgGuide/programmingnotes.html#programming-notes) for C.

### Goroutines

Goroutines are supported since YDBGo is implemented using YottaDB's multi-threading API, including mechanisms to maintain engine integrity during concurrent access. Direct calls to the YottaDB C API should be avoided as they may bypass this protection.

Goroutines are subject to the requirements stated in the documentation for C [Threads](https://docs.yottadb.com/MultiLangProgGuide/programmingnotes.html#threads). However, its requirements for [error buffers](https://docs.yottadb.com/MultiLangProgGuide/programmingnotes.html#threads) and [transaction tokens](https://docs.yottadb.com/MultiLangProgGuide/programmingnotes.html#threads-and-transaction-processing) are fully managed by the YDBGo wrapper, placing no burden on the programmer except that each goroutine must have its own instances of [yottadb.Conn](https://pkg.go.dev/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2#Conn), and [yottadb.Node](https://pkg.go.dev/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2#Node).

Although Goroutines are fully supported, you should be aware that if the goroutines are database-intensive rather than computationally intensive, they will run faster as parallel *processes* than as parallel *goroutines*. As the database engine itself is not multi-threaded, all goroutine access to the database is internally gated and queued through a single thread: only computational activity in Go is done in parallel.

### Signals

As discussed in [Signals](https://docs.yottadb.com/MultiLangProgGuide/programmingnotes.html#signals), the YottaDB runtime system uses signals. When the Go wrapper is in use, the YottaDB runtime system receives signals from the Go runtime system through the Go wrapper, instead of directly from the operating system. YDBGo registers handlers with the Go runtime system for the following signals:

- **fatal signals:** SIGABRT, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGSEGV, SIGTERM, SIGTRAP
- **non-fatal signals:** SIGALRM, SIGCONT, SIGHUP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, SIGURG, SIGUSR1

In addition, the following two signals have the same signal numbers as other handled signals:

- SIGIO is a duplicate of SIGURG
- SIGIOT is a duplicate of SIGABRT

By default these signals simply call [`yottadb.NotifyYDB()`](https://pkg.go.dev/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2#NotifyYDB) to let YottaDB handle the signal. Users may set up their own channel to be notified of a signal instead of YottaDB by calling [`yottadb.SignalNotify()`](https://pkg.go.dev/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2#SignalNotify), which has the same function signature as Go's [`signal.Notify()`](https://pkg.go.dev/os/signal#Notify). The user's handler must then notify YottaDB of the signal, as appropriate, by calling [`yottadb.NotifyYDB()`](https://pkg.go.dev/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2#NotifyYDB) before, during, or after the user's own handling of the signal, depending on the application's needs. If you omit notification of YottaDB, be sure that you know what you know what you are doing, as YottaDB expects to be notified of signals.

Use [`yottadb.SignalNotify()`](https://pkg.go.dev/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2#SignalNotify) in preference to Go's `signal.Notify()`, especially for fatal signals. If an application uses `signal.Notify()`, both it and YottaDB are notified concurrently about the signal -- whichever handler finishes first may exit with a panic, which will shutdown the database. Although this shutdown will be clean (assuming adherence to [Database Integrity](#database-integrity) below), the shutdown may cause the unfinished handler to receive `ydberr.CALLINAFTERXIT` errors from the database.

**Note:** Although it is possible to capture program execution errors such as SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, and SIGSEGV, recovery is not always possible, and they may indicate that corruption has already occurred. In these cases you should best to verify database integrity when convenient (see [MUPIP INTEG](https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/dbmgmt.html#integ)), and take appropriate action if damage is encountered (see [MUPIP JOURNAL RECOVER BACKWARD](https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/ydbjournal.html#backward-recovery) / [MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK BACKWARD](https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/ydbjournal.html#rollback-on-line-noo-nline)).

### Database Integrity

YDBGo v2 has more robust handling of abnormal program termination. As in v1, before a program exits it must call `yottadb.Shutdown()` to flush database buffers and preserve database integrity. Since Go does not support `atexit()`, you must achieve this by having the main goroutine invoke `defer yottadb.Shutdown()`, and all other goroutines must `defer ShutdownOnPanic()`, a new function in v2. This is documented in more detail at [`yottadb.Shutdown()`](https://pkg.go.dev/lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb/v2#Shutdown).

If these instructions were not followed and a panic occurs when multiple goroutines were updating the database, you will need to follow the repair action in the **note** above.

## Contributing

Last, if you plan to commit, you should set-up pre-commit hooks.

```sh
ln -s ../../pre-commit .git/hooks
go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest
```

To develop the YottaDB Go wrapper itself you may wish to import a *local* version of the wrapper instead of the public wrapper on the internet. To do this, clone the wrapper, then in a separate directory create your application that uses the wrapper and use `go work` commands to point it to the wrapper on your local file system rather than the internet repository.

To do so, run the following commands in the client app directory:

```sh
go work init
go work use . /your/local/path/to/YDBGo/v2  # Set this path to your YDBGo clone
git ignore go.work
```

The `git ignore` line prevents you from committing this local change to the public who will not have your local wrapper clone.

Now you can modify the YottaDB Go wrapper elsewhere on your local file system, and it will be immediately used by your client application, even before you commit the wrapper changes.

If you are developing YDBGo itself, you may find it useful to increase debugMode to increase debug logging as documented in `yottadb.go`. This is a private variable that cannot be set by the YDBGo user. It is only intended for use by developers of YDBGo. Coverage tests turn it on to ensure coverage of that debug portion of the code.

### Testing

To test this wrapper:

- `go build` only does a test compilation; it does not produce any files; `go install` has no effect.

- To run tests, run `make test`

- To run benchmarks, run `make bench`

  * Some CPUs gradually warm up during benchmarking, making the first few benchmark tests unfairly faster. Benchmark results are a lot more accurate and fair if you install [`perflock`](https://github.com/aclements/perflock), which `make bench` will then invoke it automatically.

  * Perflock is apparently less effective on some CPUs. You can test whether it's working to produce consistent results by running  `make check` which will run each benchmark several times so that you can see whether you're experiencing warm-up effects as the multiple tests run.

#### Advanced Testing

More rigorous tests can be performed with the `go test -asan` to catch illegal memory access errors, and it may even be run against a full ASAN build of YottaDB, in which case the `-asan` option is required.

If you wish to run against a YottaDB build that is not in the default location (e.g. an ASAN build), you will need to do the following to switch YottaDB build:

```sh
export ydb_dist=/path/to/yottadb
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$ydb_dist
go clean -r -cache -testcache   # remove artifacts from previous builds
go test [-asan] [-v] [-x]
```

* Include `-asan` to catch illegal memory access errors.
* Include `-v` to list each test as it is performed.
* Include `-x` if you wish to list all linked files to ensure you're building against the correct libraries (e.g. an ASAN build of YottaDB).

### Docker Container

The Dockerfile included in this repository creates an Ubuntu image with YottaDB, Go, and some basic development tools (git, gcc, make, vim, etc).

To **build the Docker container** run:

```sh
docker build . -t ydbgo
```

To **use the container to develop** a YDBGo project in your `~/goprojects` directory, from the `YDBGo` directory, run:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v ~/goprojects:/goprojects -v .:/YDBGo -w /goprojects ydbgo bash
```

Then follow the instructions for usage and setting up for development above.

Alternatively, may be able to use your local YDBGo directory from within the docker container. But you might have to add `-e ydb_chset=UTF-8 ` to the  docker command line to match docker's expectations of the files built in your local YDBGo directory.
