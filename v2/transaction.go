// Transaction processes database logic inside a database transaction.
//   - `callback` must be a function that implements the required database logic.
//   - `transId` has its first 8 bytes recorded in the commit record of journal files for database regions participating in the transaction.
//     Note that a transId of case-insensitive "BATCH" or "BA" are special: see [Conn.TransactionFast]()
//   - `localsToRestore` are names of local M variables to be restored to their original values when a transaction is restarted.
//     If localsToRestore[0] equals "*" then all local M database variables are restored on restart. Note that since Go has its own local
//     variables it is unlikely that you will need this feature in Go.
//   - Returns true to indicate that the transaction logic was successful and has been committed to the database, or false if a rollback was necessary.
//   - Panics on errors because they are are all panic-worthy (e.g. invalid variable names). See [yottadb.Error] for rationale.
//
// The callback function should:
//   - Implement the required database logic taking into account key considerations for [Transaction Processing] code.
//   - If there are database collisions, `callback` will be called repeatedly, rolling back the database before each call. On the
//     fourth try, YottaDB will resort to calling it with other processes locked out to ensure its success.
//   - Call [Conn.Restart] if it needs to rollback and immediately restart the transaction function
//   - Call [Conn.Rollback] if it needs to rollback and immediately exit the transaction function
//
// Transaction nesting level may be determined within the callback function by reading the special variable [$tlevel], and the number of restart
// repetitions by [$trestart]. These things are documented in more detail in [Transaction Processing].
